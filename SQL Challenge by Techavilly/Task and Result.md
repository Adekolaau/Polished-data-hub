#Introduction to My Techavilly SQL Challenge Journey

I am excited to embark on this 30-day SQL challenge organized by Techavilly. Over the next month, I'll be tackling daily SQL questions, striving to find elegant and efficient solutions, and sharing my queries along with the results with all of you.

SQL is a powerful tool for managing and querying data, and I believe this challenge will be a great opportunity to sharpen my skills and learn from the diverse community of participants here on Techavilly.

Let's dive in and make the most of this challenge together! ðŸš€

**Day 1**
-- Using the Movie Data, write a query to show the titles and movies released in 2017 whose vote count is more than 15 and runtime is more than 100

SELECT original_title, release_date

FROM [Movies].[dbo].[Movie Data]

WHERE YEAR(release_date) = 2017

AND vote_count > 15

AND runtime > 100;

**_Approach:_**

**SELECT** Statement: Begin by specifying what needs to be displayed, which, in this case, is the 'titles' and 'movies' that meet the given criteria.

**FROM** Statement: Use the FROM statement to identify the source table, which is the "Movie Data" table in the "Movies" database.

**WHERE** Statement: Apply filtering conditions using the WHERE statement. Break down the WHERE statement into multiple conditions to ensure that only the desired results are returned:

- Use the YEAR() function to extract the year from the "release_date" column.
- Check if the extracted year is equal to 2017.
- Use the AND operator to combine multiple conditions, ensuring that all requirements are met.
- Filter movies with a "vote_count" greater than 15 and a "runtime" greater than 100 minutes.
