**RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON ANALYSIS INSIGHTS**

**Top-Performing Products:**

1. Computers:

- With the highest revenue across all promotions, especially during “Anniversary Promotion”, “Xmas Holiday Promotion”, and “Easter Promotion”. These products show a consistently strong profit margin and contribute significantly to the YoY % profit and growth.

2. Cameras and Camcorders:

- Products in the “Cameras and camcorders” category perform well, particularly during promotions like “Ramadan Promotion” and “New Year Promotion”. They contribute significantly to revenue, maintain a healthy profit margin, and contribute significantly to YoY growth.

3. TV and Video:

- “TV and Video” products show strong performance, especially during “Ramadan Promotion”, “New Year Promotion”, and “Hammartan Promotion”. They contribute to both revenue and profit, with a consistent profit margin and contribute significantly to YoY growth.

**_Recommendation:_** Continue to focus on marketing and promoting “computers”, “cameras and camcorders”, and “TV and video” products possibly exploring new promotions or bundling strategies to maintain and enhance its leading position.

- Expand the range of computer products or accessories to maintain and potentially increase revenue. Leverage the strong market presence of computers for cross-selling opportunities.

**Products for Discontinuation:**

1. Audio:

- The Audio category, despite being the least revenue generator, it appears to be the consistently lowest revenue across all promotions, relatively lower profit margins, and limited YoY % Growth compared to other products.

2. Low-Performing Products:

3. Declining Products:

- Identify products that have shown a consistent decline in revenue and profit over the years. Look for promotions where certain products, perhaps in the “Music, Movies, and Audio Books” category during “Black Friday Promotion,” have experienced a decrease in both profit margin and YoY growth.

4. Cost-to-Revenue Ratio:

- Analyze the products with a higher cost-to-revenue ratio, especially those with a ratio above the average for your business.

- Given its status as the highest revenue generator, consider strategic investments in the North West region. Tailor marketing and product availability to local preferences to maximize returns.
