/* ðŸš€ Weekends are for bonus questions, and here's how I tackled my bonus question for the #30Daysqlchallenge
Question: The Briggs company wants to ship some of their products to customers in selected cities but they want to know the average days itâ€™ll take to deliver those items to Dallas, LOS Angeles, Seattle, and Madison. Using sample superstore data, write a query to show the average delivery days to those cities. Only show the city and average delivery days columns in your output. */

SELECT
	city AS City,
	AVG(DATEDIFF(day, order_date, ship_date)) AS AverageDeliveryDays
FROM
	[Movies].[dbo].[Orders]
WHERE
 	city IN ('Dallas', 'Los Angeles', 'Seattle', 'Madison')
GROUP BY
	city
ORDER BY
	city;

/* Approach:
1. I SELECTed the "city" column, aliasing it as "City," and calculated the average delivery days using the AVG function along with DATEDIFF to find the difference in days between the "order_date" and "ship_date."
2. To focus solely on the specified cities, I employed the WHERE clause with the IN operator.
3. Grouping my results by city, I harnessed the power of the GROUP BY clause.
4. To keep things organized, I ordered the results in ascending order by city using the ORDER BY clause. */
