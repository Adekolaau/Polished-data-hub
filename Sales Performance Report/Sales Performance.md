**RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON ANALYSIS INSIGHTS**

**Top-Performing Products:**

1. Computers:

- With the highest revenue across all promotions, especially during “Anniversary Promotion”, “Xmas Holiday Promotion”, and “Easter Promotion”. These products show a consistently strong profit margin and contribute significantly to the YoY % profit and growth.

2. Cameras and Camcorders:

- Products in the “Cameras and camcorders” category perform well, particularly during promotions like “Ramadan Promotion” and “New Year Promotion”. They contribute significantly to revenue, maintain a healthy profit margin, and contribute significantly to YoY growth.

3. TV and Video:

- “TV and Video” products show strong performance, especially during “Ramadan Promotion”, “New Year Promotion”, and “Hammartan Promotion”. They contribute to both revenue and profit, with a consistent profit margin and contribute significantly to YoY growth.

**_Recommendation:_** Continue to focus on marketing and promoting “computers”, “cameras and camcorders”, and “TV and video” products possibly exploring new promotions or bundling strategies to maintain and enhance its leading position.

- Expand the range of computer products or accessories to maintain and potentially increase revenue. Leverage the strong market presence of computers for cross-selling opportunities.

**Products for Discontinuation:**

1. Audio:

- The Audio category, despite being the least revenue generator, it appears to be the consistently lowest revenue across all promotions, relatively lower profit margins, and limited YoY % Growth compared to other products.

2. Low-Performing Products:

- Consider discontinuing products in categories or specific promotions that consistently show low revenue, profit margins, and YoY growth. For example, evaluate the performance of products in the “Audio” category, especially during promotions like “Sallah Promotion” and “Summer Promotion.”

3. Declining Products:

- Identify products that have shown a consistent decline in revenue and profit over the years. Look for promotions where certain products, perhaps in the “Music, Movies, and Audio Books” category during “Black Friday Promotion,” have experienced a decrease in both profit margin and YoY growth.

4. Cost-to-Revenue Ratio:

- Analyze the products with a higher cost-to-revenue ratio, especially those with a ratio above the average for your business. Products in the “Cameras and camcorders” category during promotions like “Hammartan Promotion” might be considered for discontinuation if the cost-to-revenue ratio is consistently high.

**_Recommendation:_** Consider scrutinizing for potential discontinuing or re-evaluating the marketing strategy for audio products. You can also potentially phase out less profitable audio products. Evaluate the cost-to-revenue ratio and consider reallocating resources to more profitable product lines.

**Best-Selling Channels:**

1. Store Channel:

- The store channel consistently outperforms others in terms of revenue. Strengthening the product offerings and marketing strategies in-store can capitalize on this channel’s success.

2. Online Channel:

- With the second-highest revenue, the online channel remains a robust performer. Optimize the online presence, invest in digital marketing, and ensure a seamless online shopping experience to further enhance performance.

**_Recommendation:_** Strengthen store and online sales strategies, invest in digital marketing, and explore partnerships with popular store and online platforms.

**Regional Insights and Channel Recommendations:**

1. North West Region:

- Given its status as the highest revenue generator, consider strategic investments in the North West region. Tailor marketing and product availability to local preferences to maximize returns.

2. North Central Region:

- The North Central region is a significant contributor to revenue. Strengthen partnerships with mobile outlet, store and explore opportunities to expand product offerings in this region.

3. South West Region:

- Leverage the potential of the South West region by enhancing the product portfolio and marketing strategies, particularly through online and in-store channels.

4. Optimizing Channels:

- Evaluate the cost efficiency of each channel and prioritize investments in channels with higher profitability. Consider reallocating resources to optimize the performance of mobile outlet and reseller channels.

**Product-to-Revenue Ratio Analysis:**

1. Computers, Cameras/Camcorders, and TV and Video:

- These categories consistently show a high product-to-revenue ratio, especially TV and Video category.
- It Indicates efficient revenue generation relative to product quantity.
