**Unlocking Opportunities with Forage**

The journey began when I stumbled upon an intriguing opportunity by Forage â€” a chance to simulate a job role in data visualization. The promise of hands-on experience, guided by industry professionals, was too tempting to resist. I decided to dive in, and little did I know that this virtual internship would be a transformative experience.

**Tasks and Learnings**

**Task 1** â€” _Framing the Business Scenario_

The first task was all about thinking like a business leader. I was tasked with anticipating the questions that a CEO and CMO might ask about their online retail storeâ€™s performance. The objective? To provide valuable insights for strategic planning. It was a challenge to balance quantitative and qualitative aspects in crafting those essential questions.

**Task 2** â€” _Choosing the Right Visuals_

Visualizations are the bridge between raw data and actionable insights. Task 2 pushed me to explore the art of selecting the right visuals for conveying data effectively. A crucial skill in the world of data visualization. The importance of this skill cannot be overstated; itâ€™s the visual that can make or break the message.

**Task 3** â€” _Creating Effective Visuals_

With a strong foundation, I moved on to the next phase: creating visuals. Armed with Power BI, I cleaned the data and created visuals to answer specific questions. The importance of data cleaning became clear as I worked to ensure data accuracy and consistency. The visuals I crafted were intended to aid business leaders in making informed decisions, and precision was key.

**Task 4** â€” _Communicating Insights and Analysis_

The culmination of this journey was a presentation to the CEO and CMO. This was not merely a recitation of charts and graphs; it was a story of how data could inform decisions. I walked them through my entire process, from data cleaning to the insights gained.
