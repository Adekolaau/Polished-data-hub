# NIGERIA COVID-19 PANDEMIC¬†MONITOR

**INTRODUCTION**

What started out as an unplanned leave of absence from my institution in the early months of 2020 quickly turned into something none of us could have predicted. I can still clearly remember the moment the university administration announced a two-week break for students in what seemed like a seemingly routine announcement. This abrupt halt had previously been observed by several universities, but my university in Edo State was not far behind. I decided to stay nearer to my school, so I drove to Kwara State to spend the short holiday with my aunt. I was completely ignorant that the two weeks I had planned to spend with her would actually turn into months.

When we were confined to our homes, the global pandemic, known as COVID-19, began to weave its complex narrative across Nigeria. As we followed the virus's spread on news channels and social media, we saw how it worsened in different states and left a path of death in its wake. As a result, public health interventions like using protective gear and the practice of social distancing became essential tools in slowing the virus's spread.

State-by-state implementation of phased lockdowns and slow containment attempts occurred as the country struggled with the obstacles posed by the virus. Vaccines proved to be the ultimate breakthrough, providing a ray of hope and enabling the return to normalcy.

Today, I present to you a live dashboard sourced from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) website. It is evidence of the continuous fight against COVID-19 in Nigeria. This dashboard shows that the threat is still present, despite the fact that many people may have thought the pandemic was a thing of the past due to the daily ups and downs of life. The NCDC assures us that the fight against COVID-19 is far from done by continuing its diligent efforts to manage and mitigate the present instances, even though they are not generally acknowledged.

In terms of active cases, Lagos State is still topping the chart with a noticeably more active case, while Rivers State has noticeably fewer active cases.

**_Active Cases and Recovery Rate by State Affected_**

There is a positive correlation between Active Cases and Recovery Rate, as the treatment administered or the safety measures taken are very effective.

**_Mortality Rate by States Affected_**

Kogi State has a noticeably higher Mortality Rate.

**_Note:_** When the total cases for each state exceed 5000, the state bubble turns red, indicating that the states with bubble representations that are now red have more than 5000 total cases, and when the active cases exceed 100, the bar column of that state turns red.
